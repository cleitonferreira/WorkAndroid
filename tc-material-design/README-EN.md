In the begin this APP was developed just to be part of a serie named Material Design on Android, but it is supposed to be easier to understanding other Android videos in a channel if we keep working on a real APP, since then this APP is now an official example APP of Thiengo's Blog and Channels.

*Note that there is a second part of this project, I meant, a server side part where we have some PHP scripts those were tested in a Apache 2.2 (no big deal if you are using NGINX, it's supposed to works fine too) using also an MySQL like an official SGBD of this project.
